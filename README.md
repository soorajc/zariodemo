# Zario prototype app

A prototype for handling the social media screen time usage.

# Description

It works as described below:

1.  The user opens the social tracker app.

2.  He / She selects the social media app that he/she wants to use.

3.  The app will automatically redirect the user to the social media app selected and will set an alarm that will be fired after 5 minutes\*\*.

        **For now the time is set default as 5 minutes we can set it dynamically using the user input. **-

        Currently the iOS demo app does not have the reminder functionality; it will work only on real devices not on simulators.

4.  After 5 minutes the alarm will be fired over the social media app displaying a message - " the time is up please take a screen break."
